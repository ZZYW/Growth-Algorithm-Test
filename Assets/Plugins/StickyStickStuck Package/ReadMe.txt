The Sticky Stick Stuck package allows you to easily drag and drop, or dynamically create, a customizable stickiness to a GameObject allowing you to stick/glue objects together. 

Features include:
- Sticky Type, allowing you to pick different types of stickiness, and easily access the Sticky Type properties.
- Break Options, giving you the ability to break the stickiness.
- Max Stuck, allows you to set the max number of items stuck on a given object.
- Special Effects, easily add any kind of effect that is stuck to an object, for example a particle effect.
- Recursive Infection, allowing you to spread the Sticky Stick Stuck script throughout any object that it touches.
- Clean Up, if you have a complex sticky object, if disabled or destroyed, it cleans all related Sticky Stick Stuck data, and returns to a normal state.

Sticky Stick Stuck makes it incredibly easy to add a customizable stickiness to arrows, complex magnets, or even sticky explosives! The demos and tutorials below show just how easy and powerful this package can be.
